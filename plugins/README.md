# Lorelum plugins

Each direct child of this directory is an independently installable Plugin artifact for one host. It contains the host-specific lifecycle integration, context rendering, Skills, and distribution metadata; it is not a shared Engine layer.

`lorelum/` is the current Codex Plugin, published as `lorelum@lorelum` and shown as **Lorelum**. It calls the public `lore` CLI for Pack metadata. It must not import Engine packages, read LocalStore files directly, or reproduce retrieval and ranking behavior.

## Current integration boundary

Lorelum is CLI-first. Host Plugins use the compiled `lore` CLI plus host-native Skills and Hooks; they do not start, bundle, configure, or call a local MCP server. Do not add a local MCP convenience layer, stdio server, MCP tools, or MCP-backed UI while developing a Plugin. MCP is reserved for a separately approved future platform remote-retrieval service, not a local performance or integration optimization. See [the active scope decision](../docs/plans/agent-integration-scope.md).

Do not add placeholder directories for future agents. When another host needs a real integration, define its independent install and trust model first; only then add its artifact here or choose a host-required marketplace layout. A future `learn` capability remains inside the relevant host Plugin unless it later requires independent installation, permissions, trust, audience, or release cadence.
