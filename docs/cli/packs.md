# Manage Knowledge Packs

Pack mutations operate on one LocalStore. Use the global `--store-root <path>` option to select an isolated Store for development or automation; otherwise the CLI uses the user-level default Store.

```sh
# Install the latest Registry release selected by the Registry contract.
lore pack install agentic-coding

# Install or update one exact release from a chosen Registry repository.
lore pack install agentic-coding@0.1.0 --registry acme/team-packs
lore pack update agentic-coding@0.2.0 --registry acme/team-packs

# Remove one active Pack from the selected Store.
lore --store-root ./tmp/lore-store pack remove agentic-coding
```

`lore pack install` is idempotent only when the resolved artifact matches the active Pack exactly. If the same Pack name resolves to different content, it returns `pack.update-required` and leaves the Store unchanged. Use `lore pack update` to replace that Pack's sources with the selected release.

`lore pack update` and `lore pack remove` return `pack.not-installed` when the named Pack is not active in the selected Store. All successful mutations return the committed `generation`, `effectiveRevision`, affected Practice `delta`, validation `diagnostics`, and `cleanupPending` state in the normal JSON envelope. Install and update additionally report the resolved Pack version, Registry, Git source, artifact digest, and whether the operation was idempotent.

There is no bulk “update every Pack” operation. Each Pack update resolves one explicit Pack release, making Store changes and automation inputs deterministic. Root `lore update` is reserved for Lore's own version-management contract.
